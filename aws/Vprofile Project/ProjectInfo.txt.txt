===========================================
VPROFILE - MULTI-TIER WEB APPLICATION (AWS)
===========================================

ðŸš€ PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
Objective:
Lift-and-shift of a multi-tier web application "vProfile" to AWS Cloud 
for better scalability, automation, and reduced operational overhead.

Deployment Strategy:
Cloud-first with focus on IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

Goals:
- Pay-as-you-go pricing (no upfront capex)
- Auto-scalability
- Simplified infrastructure management
- High availability
- Automation of deployments

===================================================
ðŸ”§ AWS SERVICES USED (With Purpose)
===================================================

1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
   - Hosts vProfile App on Apache Tomcat
   - Hosts backend services: MySQL, RabbitMQ, Memcache

2. ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) - Application Load Balancer (ALB)
   - Distributes traffic across tomcat servers
   - Replaces Nginx
   - Supports HTTPS via ACM certificate

3. Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
   - Automatically adds/removes Tomcat EC2s based on load
   - Ensures high availability and scalability

4. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
   - Stores artifacts, static files, backups

5. Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
   - Provides shared file system for Tomcat EC2s (if needed)

6. Route 53
   - Public Hosted Zone: Maps domain to ALB via GoDaddy
   - Private Hosted Zone: Internal DNS resolution for backend services

7. IAM (Identity & Access Management)
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure access to EC2, S3, EFS, etc.

8. ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)
   - Issues and manages SSL/TLS certificates
   - Enables HTTPS on ALB

9. Security Groups
   - SG1: ALB - Allows HTTPS (443) from the internet
   - SG2: Tomcat EC2s - Allows 8080 only from SG1
   - SG3: Backend services - Allows only internal traffic from SG2

===================================================
ðŸ’¡ BENEFITS OF THIS SETUP
===================================================
- Fully managed infrastructure
- Auto-scalability of application tier
- Separation of concerns with security groups
- Secure communication via HTTPS and private DNS
- Cost-optimized: Pay only for what you use
- Highly available and fault-tolerant
