# Steps to Create an Image/AMI of an EC2 Instance

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a snapshot of an EC2 instance used to launch new instances with the same configuration.

## To create an AMI:
1. Open the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. Select **Instances** from the left panel.
3. Right-click on the instance or choose **Actions > Image and templates > Create image**.
4. Provide a name and optional description for the AMI.
5. Choose whether to **reboot the instance** (recommended to ensure a clean state).
6. Click **Create Image**.
7. AMI creation will begin, and you can monitor progress under **Images > AMIs**.

# Moving an Instance to Another Region using AMI

If you want to move an EC2 instance from one region to another, AMI is the recommended way.

## Steps:
1. First, **create an AMI** of the instance (as described above).
2. Go to **EC2 Dashboard > Images > AMIs**.
3. Select the AMI, then choose **Actions > Copy AMI**.
4. Choose the **destination region** and provide a name.
5. Click **Copy AMI**.
6. Switch to the destination region and launch a new instance using the copied AMI.

# Sharing or Making an AMI Public

You can make an AMI:
- **Public**: Anyone can see and launch the image.
- **Shared**: Only specific AWS account IDs can use the AMI.

## To share an AMI:
1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard > Images > AMIs**.
2. Select your AMI, then choose **Actions > Modify Image Permissions**.
3. Choose:
   - **Public** to make it available to all AWS users, or
   - **Private** and specify AWS Account IDs to share access.
4. Save changes.

Note: You must also share associated **EBS snapshots** for the AMI to work correctly.

# Difference Between AMI and Snapshot

| Feature               | AMI                                      | Snapshot                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Purpose              | Used to launch new EC2 instances         | Backup of EBS volume                     |
| Contents             | Includes one or more EBS snapshots plus launch configuration | Contains data from a single EBS volume   |
| Usage Scope          | Full instance configuration (OS, data, permissions) | Only EBS volume data                    |
| Creation Location    | From an instance                         | From a specific EBS volume               |
| Restorability        | Used to create new instances             | Used to create new volumes               |

# Launch Templates

Launch Templates in AWS allow you to predefine all instance launch settings like:
- AMI ID
- Instance type
- Key pair
- Security groups
- User data
- Tags
- IAM roles

They simplify launching EC2 instances consistently and are often used with **Auto Scaling**, **Spot Instances**, and **EC2 Fleet**.

## Steps to Create a Launch Template:
1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard > Launch Templates**.
2. Click **Create launch template**.
3. Provide a **Template name** and optional description.
4. Choose the **AMI**, **Instance type**, and other required settings.
5. Configure **key pair**, **network settings**, **security groups**, and **storage volumes** as needed.
6. Optionally add **user data** and **tags**.
7. Click **Create launch template**.

## Steps to Launch an Instance from a Launch Template:
1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard > Launch Templates**.
2. Select the desired template.
3. Click **Actions > Launch instance from template**.
4. Choose the **version** of the template (default is latest).
5. Review or adjust any settings if needed.
6. Click **Launch instance**.

# Summary

- **AMI** is a reusable instance image that can be shared, copied across regions, or made public.
- **Snapshots** are volume-level backups, often part of AMIs.
- **Launch Templates** help streamline launching consistent EC2 instances with predefined settings.
