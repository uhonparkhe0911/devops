# Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets – such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses – within one or more Availability Zones.

## Types of ELB:
1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** – Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS). Best suited for web applications with content-based routing.
2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** – Operates at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP/TLS). Used for high performance and low latency.
3. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)** – Used to deploy and manage third-party virtual appliances, like firewalls or traffic inspection tools.

# Target Groups

A Target Group is used to route requests to one or more registered targets (such as EC2 instances) based on health checks and rules.

Each target group routes requests to one or more registered targets using the protocol and port number you specify.

## Steps to Create a Target Group:
1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard > Target Groups**.
2. Click **Create target group**.
3. **Choose target type**:
   - Instances (register EC2 instances)
   - IP addresses
   - Lambda functions
4. **Target group name**: e.g., `wavecafe-target-group`
5. **Protocol**: HTTP or HTTPS (based on your application)
6. **Port**: Port on which your app is listening (e.g., 80)
7. **VPC**: Select the VPC in which your instances are running
8. **Health checks**:
   - **Protocol**: HTTP
   - **Path**: `/` or a specific path like `/health`
   - Optional: Change health check thresholds, timeout, interval, etc.
9. Click **Next**, then **Register targets**
10. Select the instances (e.g., `wavecafe-web01` and `wavecafe-web02`) and ports, then click **Include as pending**
11. Click **Create target group**

# Steps to Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB):

1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard > Load Balancers**
2. Click **Create Load Balancer > Application Load Balancer**
3. **Name**: e.g., `wavecafe-alb`
4. **Scheme**: internet-facing (for public access) or internal
5. **IP address type**: IPv4 or dualstack
6. **Network mapping**:
   - Select your **VPC**
   - Select **all Availability Zones** (with one subnet per AZ) to make your load balancer highly available
7. **Security groups**:
   - Create or select a security group that allows inbound traffic on the listener port (e.g., HTTP 80)
8. **Listeners and routing**:
   - Protocol: HTTP
   - Port: 80
   - Forward to: previously created **Target Group** (e.g., `wavecafe-target-group`)
9. **Register targets** (if not done earlier)
10. Review and click **Create Load Balancer**

After a few minutes, the ELB becomes active and starts routing traffic to healthy targets like:
- `wavecafe-web01`
- `wavecafe-web02`

# Troubleshooting: 504 Gateway Timeout and Unhealthy Targets

If your instances return a **504 Gateway Timeout** error:
- Make sure your **instance security group** has an **inbound rule that allows traffic from the ELB's security group** on the required port (e.g., port 80).
- If this rule is missing, the target group health checks will fail and show **unhealthy** status for both instances.
- After adding the ELB security group to the instance's inbound rules, the health checks will pass and your website will load successfully.

# Managing Instances in Target Group

You can **add more instances** to the target group anytime if you want to scale your application.

Similarly, you can **remove/deregister instances** from the target group:
- For maintenance
- During deployments
- Or when you no longer need them

These changes are reflected in real-time, and the ELB will automatically update its routing based on the health of the current targets.
