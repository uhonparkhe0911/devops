Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)

Amazon EFS is a scalable, fully-managed, NFS-based cloud file system that can be mounted simultaneously by multiple EC2 instances.

It provides a shared file storage for Linux workloads and scales automatically as files are added or removed.

EFS vs EBS – Key Differences

Feature             | EBS (Elastic Block Store)            | EFS (Elastic File System)
---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------
Type                | Block storage                        | Network file system (NFS)
Attached to         | A single EC2 instance                | Multiple EC2 instances (concurrently)
OS Compatibility    | Linux and Windows                    | Linux only
Scalability         | Pre-defined size (resizable manually)| Automatically scales
Performance         | High-performance SSD/HDD options     | Scales with number of clients
Use Case            | Databases, boot volumes              | Shared storage, app config, home dirs
Cost                | Pay for provisioned volume           | Pay per GB used

Creating Security Group for EFS (NFS Access)

1. Go to VPC Dashboard > Security Groups
2. Click Create security group
3. Set:
   - Name: e.g., efs-sg
   - Description: Security group for NFS
   - VPC: Same VPC as your EC2 instance
4. Under Inbound rules, click Add Rule:
   - Type: NFS
   - Port: 2049
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source: Select Custom and enter the EC2 instance security group ID
5. Click Create security group

Create EFS File System

1. Go to the Amazon EFS Console
2. Click Create file system
3. Enter:
   - Name: e.g., wavecafe-efs
   - VPC: Same as EC2 instance
4. Click Customize to configure mount targets:
   - One mount target per AZ/subnet will be created
   - For each mount target, attach the EFS security group you created (efs-sg)
5. Click Next, then Create

Creating EFS Access Point

An EFS Access Point is a named entry point that enforces a specific directory path and POSIX user/group permissions for access, simplifying multi-user and container use cases.

Steps to create an Access Point

1. In the EFS Console, select your file system (e.g., fs-abc12345)
2. Go to the Access Points tab
3. Click Create access point
4. Enter a Name (e.g., webapp-access-point)
5. Specify Root directory path (e.g., /webapp)
   - AWS will create this directory if it doesn’t exist
6. Set Root directory creation permissions:
   - Owner UID: 1000
   - Owner GID: 1000
   - Permissions: 755
7. (Optional) Set POSIX user for all file system requests:
   - UID: 1000
   - GID: 1000
8. Click Create Access Point

Using EFS on Amazon Linux 2 with Access Point

To mount EFS, install the amazon-efs-utils package which provides the EFS mount helper and supports encryption.

1. Install amazon-efs-utils

sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils

2. Create a mount directory

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/efs

3. Mount manually for testing (optional)

sudo mount -t efs -o tls,accesspoint=fsap-xyz12345 fs-abc12345:/ /mnt/efs

- Replace fs-abc12345 with your EFS File System ID
- Replace fsap-xyz12345 with your Access Point ID
- -o tls enables encryption in transit

4. Update /etc/fstab for automatic mounting

Add the following line to /etc/fstab:

file-system-id:/ efs-mount-point efs _netdev,noresvport,tls,accesspoint=access-point-id 0 0

Example:

fs-011ac358e921d6dc7 /var/www/html/images efs _netdev,noresvport,tls,accesspoint=fsap-021e54c9357fffd11 0 0

5. Mount all entries from /etc/fstab

sudo mount -fav

You should see output indicating the EFS was successfully mounted.

6. Verify mount point

df -h

You should see your EFS file system listed mounted at your specified mount point.

Summary

- Create a security group allowing inbound NFS (port 2049) only from your EC2 instance security group.
- Create an EFS file system and mount targets with the correct security group.
- Create an EFS access point to control directory root and permissions.
- Install amazon-efs-utils on Amazon Linux 2 for mounting.
- Configure /etc/fstab with the recommended options for automatic mounting using the EFS mount helper.
- Use mount -fav to mount all file systems defined in /etc/fstab and verify with df -h.

---

Your EC2 instances can now securely mount a scalable shared file system with fine-grained access control and automatic mounting on reboot.
