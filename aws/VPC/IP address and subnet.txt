### IPv4 Networking and Subnet Masks

#### 1. What is IPv4?

* IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the 4th version of the Internet Protocol, widely used to identify devices on a network using an addressing system.
* IPv4 uses a **32-bit address**, represented in dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
* Total possible addresses: **2^32 = 4,294,967,296** addresses.

---

#### 2. IPv4 Address Structure

An IPv4 address is divided into two parts:

* **Network ID** – identifies the network.
* **Host ID** – identifies a device within that network.

Example: `192.168.1.10/24`

* Network ID: 192.168.1.0
* Host ID range: 192.168.1.1 – 192.168.1.254
* Broadcast address: 192.168.1.255

#### 3. Classes of IPv4 Addresses

| Class | Range (First Octet) | Default Subnet Mask | Networks  | Hosts per Network |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| A     | 0 – 127             | 255.0.0.0 (/8)      | 128       | 16,777,214        |
| B     | 128 – 191           | 255.255.0.0 (/16)   | 16,384    | 65,534            |
| C     | 192 – 223           | 255.255.255.0 (/24) | 2,097,152 | 254               |
| D     | 224 – 239           | – (Multicast)       | –         | –                 |
| E     | 240 – 255           | – (Reserved)        | –         | –                 |

#### 4. Subnet Masks

* Subnet masks define how many bits are used for the **network** and how many for the **host**.
* Written in **dotted-decimal** (e.g., 255.255.255.0) or **CIDR notation** (e.g., /24).

Examples:

* **/8** → 255.0.0.0 → 16,777,214 hosts
* **/16** → 255.255.0.0 → 65,534 hosts
* **/24** → 255.255.255.0 → 254 hosts
* **/30** → 255.255.255.252 → 2 hosts (used for point-to-point links)

---

#### 5. Private vs Public IP Ranges

* **Private IP ranges** (not routable on the Internet):

  * Class A: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
  * Class B: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
  * Class C: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
* **Public IPs** are all other addresses not in the private ranges.

---

#### 6. Special IPv4 Addresses

* **0.0.0.0** – Default route / unspecified address
* **127.0.0.1** – Loopback (localhost)
* **169.254.0.0/16** – APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)
* **Broadcast address** – last IP in a subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.255 in /24)

---

#### 7. Subnetting Example

Example: `192.168.1.0/26`

* Subnet mask: 255.255.255.192
* Number of subnets: 4
* Hosts per subnet: 62
* Ranges:

  * 192.168.1.0 – 192.168.1.63
  * 192.168.1.64 – 192.168.1.127
  * 192.168.1.128 – 192.168.1.191
  * 192.168.1.192 – 192.168.1.255

---

#### 8. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

* CIDR allows more efficient allocation of IP addresses.
* Instead of strict classes, networks are represented as `<IP>/<prefix length>`.
* Example: `192.168.1.0/28` = 16 IPs (14 usable).

---

#### 9. Key Points

* IPv4 uses **32-bit addresses**.
* Divided into **network and host** portions.
* Subnet masks define usable IP ranges.
* **Private ranges** are used in LANs, **public ranges** on the Internet.
* CIDR helps in efficient allocation.
