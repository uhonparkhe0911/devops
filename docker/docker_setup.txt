# Docker Installation on Ubuntu (End-to-End Guide)

## 1. Update System Packages
Before installing Docker, update your existing list of packages:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

## 2. Install Required Prerequisites
Install packages that allow apt to use repositories over HTTPS:
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y

## 3. Add Docker’s Official GPG Key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

## 4. Set Up the Stable Repository
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

## 5. Install Docker Engine
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y

## 6. Verify Docker Installation
Check Docker version to ensure installation was successful:
docker --version

Check Docker service status:
sudo systemctl status docker

## 7. Run Docker Without Sudo (Optional)
Add your user to the docker group so you can run commands without sudo:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Log out and back in, or run:
newgrp docker

## 8. Test Docker Installation (Hello World)
Run the test container:
docker run hello-world

- Docker pulls the hello-world image from Docker Hub if not present locally.  
- It then runs a container and prints a confirmation message.

## 9. What is Docker Hub?
- Docker Hub is Docker’s official cloud-based registry where you can find, store, and share container images.  
- Public images (like ubuntu, nginx, mysql, redis, etc.) are hosted here.  
- When you run docker run <image>, Docker first checks locally; if the image isn’t found, it pulls it from Docker Hub by default.

You can browse Docker Hub here: https://hub.docker.com

## 10. Example: Run a Container from Docker Hub
For example, to run an Nginx web server container:
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx

- This pulls the official nginx image from Docker Hub.  
- It runs the container in detached mode (-d).  
- Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 inside the container.  
- Access it in your browser at http://localhost:8080.

## Conclusion
You have successfully installed Docker on Ubuntu, tested it with the hello-world container, and learned about Docker Hub. From here, you can explore running other containers like databases, web servers, or your own applications.
