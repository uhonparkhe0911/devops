Architecture Overview (Layered Breakdown)
1. Client Layer
End users access the application via a web browser or frontend client.

Requests go through a Load Balancer, which distributes them to multiple NGINX instances for scalability and fault tolerance.

2. Web Layer – NGINX
Nginx is configured as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

It forwards HTTP requests to Tomcat (the application server).

Acts as a reverse proxy/load balancer, routing user traffic to backend services like Tomcat.

3. Application Layer – Tomcat
Tomcat hosts the vProfile Java Web Application (built using Spring Boot or similar framework).

Handles user authentication, dashboard rendering, and core business logic.

Communicates with backend services like:
MySQL for data persistence

Memcache for caching

RabbitMQ for async messaging

4. Caching Layer – Memcache
Memcache is used to cache frequently accessed data (e.g., user sessions, profile info).

Reduces load on MySQL by storing temporary results in memory.

Significantly improves response time for repeated queries

5. Data Layer – MySQL
MySQL is the primary relational database.

Stores all application data like:

User profiles

Configuration

Application state

Queries are optimized and often cached by Memcache.

6. Messaging Layer – RabbitMQ
Used for decoupling services and handling asynchronous operations.

Tomcat sends messages to RabbitMQ (e.g., for sending emails, logging, batch processing).

Ensures that non-critical operations don't block main user requests.

Useful for microservices-style architecture.

Provisioning/Setup Order
It is critical to set up services in a logical order to avoid dependency issues:

1. MySQL – The core database must be available before services depending on it start.

2. Memcache – Starts early to provide caching for the app.

3. RabbitMQ – Needs to be ready for asynchronous communication.

4. Tomcat – The application layer comes after dependencies are ready.

5. Nginx – Finally, the front-facing web service is set up to route requests to Tomcat.

Flow of Requests
Users access the application via Nginx, which load balances the traffic.

Nginx forwards requests to Tomcat (the app server).

Tomcat:

Fetches or stores data in MySQL.

Uses Memcache to cache frequent data.

Publishes tasks to RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing.

RabbitMQ queues messages for background jobs.

#########################################################

Example Request Flow
A user accesses the app via https://vprofile-app.com

NGINX routes the request to an available Tomcat server.

Tomcat:

Queries Memcache for user session

Falls back to MySQL if data not cached

Sends a background email task to RabbitMQ

Queries ElasticSearch for user activity logs

Response is sent back to NGINX → User.
