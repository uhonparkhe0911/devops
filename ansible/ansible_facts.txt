Ansible Facts and Important Variables

1. What are Ansible Facts?
   - Facts are system properties automatically discovered by Ansible from managed hosts.
   - They include details like OS, IP addresses, CPU, memory, etc.
   - These are gathered using the 'setup' module.

2. gather_facts: false
   - By default, Ansible gathers facts at the beginning of playbook execution.
   - Setting 'gather_facts: false' in a playbook disables automatic fact gathering.
   - This improves performance if facts are not required.

3. How to gather facts manually?
   - You can explicitly use the 'setup' module when needed:
     - name: Gather facts
       ansible.builtin.setup:

4. Some Important Fact Variables:
   - ansible_hostname       → Hostname of the target machine
   - ansible_all_ipv4_addresses → List of all IPv4 addresses
   - ansible_default_ipv4.address → Default IPv4 address of the system
   - ansible_os_family      → OS family (e.g., RedHat, Debian)
   - ansible_distribution   → Distribution name (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS)
   - ansible_distribution_version → Version of the OS distribution
   - ansible_processor      → CPU details
   - ansible_memtotal_mb    → Total memory (in MB)
   - ansible_memfree_mb     → Free memory (in MB)
   - ansible_fqdn           → Fully Qualified Domain Name
   - ansible_user           → Remote user running Ansible

5. Usage Example:
   - debug:
       msg: "The system {{ ansible_hostname }} has IP {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}"
