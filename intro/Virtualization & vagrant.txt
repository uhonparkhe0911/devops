What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of a computer system, including its CPU, memory, storage, and network—inside another physical machine.

You can run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on one physical computer, and each VM acts like a separate computer.

1)Why Use Virtualization?
-Save money by using fewer physical machines
-Test different operating systems or software on the same computer
-Improve resource usage
-Isolate environments for better security and testing

2)How It Works
A software layer called a hypervisor allows one physical machine to run many VMs.
There are two types of hypervisors:
-Type 1 (Bare-metal): Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V)
-Type 2 (Hosted): Runs on a host OS (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation)

Let’s say you're a developer on a Windows laptop but want to test your app in Linux.
With virtualization, you can run a virtual Linux machine inside your Windows system.

What is Vagrant?
-Vagrant is an open-source tool that helps you create and manage virtual machines in a simple, repeatable, and automated way—especially for development.
-You can think of it as a wrapper around virtualization tools like VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V, making it easier to manage VMs with just a few commands.

What Vagrant Does:
-Automatically sets up virtual machines with a configuration file (Vagrantfile)
-Makes it easy to share development environments with others
-Ensures your app runs the same way on every developer’s machine


##############################################

How Vagrant Works (Step-by-step):
-You write a Vagrantfile
-Defines the OS, memory, CPU, and software your VM needs
-Run vagrant up
-Vagrant creates a VM using a provider (like VirtualBox)
-Run vagrant ssh
-You log into the VM and work as if it's a separate machine
-Run vagrant destroy
-Deletes the VM when you're done, without affecting your real system
