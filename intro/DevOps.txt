DevOps is a way of working that brings developers (who build software) and IT operations (who run and manage it) together. The goal is to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.

Core Ideas of DevOps
1)Teamwork
Developers and operations work closely, not in separate teams.

2)Automation
Repetitive tasks like testing, building, and deploying software are done automatically.

3)Continuous Delivery
New features and fixes are released often, not just once in a while.

4)Infrastructure as Code
Servers and systems are managed with code, like software, making it easy to set up and change.

5)Monitoring
Systems are watched in real-time to catch problems early and improve performance.
