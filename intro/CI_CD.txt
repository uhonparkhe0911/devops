CI/CD in DevOps

CI/CD stands for:
1)CI – Continuous Integration
2)CD – Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment

These are key practices in DevOps to automate and speed up software development and delivery.

1)Continuous Integration (CI)
What it means:
Developers frequently (daily or more) add their code to a shared codebase (like GitHub). Every time new code is added:
-The code is automatically built
-Automated tests run to check for bugs
-Developers get quick feedback

Why it matters:
-Catches bugs early
-Avoids "it works on my machine" problems
-Makes collaboration easier

2)Continuous Delivery (CD)
What it means:
-After CI, the tested code is automatically prepared for release. 
This means it can be safely deployed to production at any time, but the actual release may still need a manual approval.

Why it matters:
-Faster, safer releases
-Less stress around deployment
-Easy rollback if needed

| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **CI**              | Code is tested & merged automatically   |
| **CD (Delivery)**   | Code is ready to release anytime        |
| **CD (Deployment)** | Code is automatically released to users |
