KUBERNETES JOBS, CRONJOBS, AND PODS - COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION
==========================================================

1. Introduction to Pods
-----------------------
- A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- A Pod can run one or more containers together.
- Pods are usually managed by higher-level controllers (like Deployments, StatefulSets).
- Pods are ephemeral: if a Pod crashes, it won’t come back unless managed by a controller.

Lifecycle:
- Runs continuously until deleted (e.g., web servers).
- Can run once and exit (e.g., batch process).

Limitation:
- If a Pod is not part of a controller, it will not restart automatically if it fails.

----------------------------------------------------------

2. Job
------
A **Job** ensures that one or more Pods run to completion successfully.

- Used for one-time tasks (batch jobs).
- Retries Pods if they fail (based on backoffLimit).
- Ensures task completion, even if Pods or nodes fail.

### Example: Job YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl
        command: ["perl", "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```

- Runs a Perl script to calculate Pi.
- restartPolicy: Never → Pods won’t restart themselves, Job controller handles retries.
- backoffLimit: 4 → Job retries up to 4 times if Pods fail.

----------------------------------------------------------

3. CronJob
----------
A **CronJob** runs Jobs on a schedule, similar to Linux cron.

- Useful for recurring tasks (backups, cleanup, scheduled reporting).
- Uses standard cron format: minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week.

### Example: CronJob YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello-cron
spec:
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"   # runs every 5 minutes
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: hello
            image: busybox
            args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo "Hello from Kubernetes CronJob"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

- Runs every 5 minutes.
- Creates a new Job each time.
- Each Job manages its own Pod(s).

4. Comparison: Pod vs Job vs CronJob
------------------------------------

| Feature            | Pod                        | Job                                    | CronJob                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Purpose            | Run containers             | Run tasks once to completion           | Run tasks on a schedule                 |
| Restart on failure | No (unless part of a Deployment/ReplicaSet) | Yes, until completion (via retries) | Yes, creates Jobs repeatedly            |
| Lifecycle          | Runs until deleted or stopped | Ends when task is complete             | Creates new Jobs at scheduled times     |
| Use case           | Web servers, APIs, apps   | Data migration, batch processing       | Backups, reporting, log rotation        |
| Controller         | None (if standalone)      | Job controller                         | CronJob controller                      |

----------------------------------------------------------

5. Best Practices
-----------------
- Use Pods for long-running services (web servers, APIs).
- Use Jobs for one-time, guaranteed tasks (migrations, batch jobs).
- Use CronJobs for scheduled, recurring tasks (backups, reports).
- Always specify resource requests and limits in Job/CronJob specs.
- For CronJobs, ensure schedule is reasonable to avoid Pod overload.
- Use history limits (`successfulJobsHistoryLimit`, `failedJobsHistoryLimit`) in CronJobs to manage old Jobs.

### Example: CronJob with History Limits
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: cleanup-cron
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"  # daily at midnight
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: cleanup
            image: busybox
            args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - "echo Cleanup started; rm -rf /data/tmp/*"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 3
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1
```

----------------------------------------------------------

6. Summary
----------
- **Pod** = Basic building block, ephemeral, not fault-tolerant by itself.
- **Job** = Ensures Pods complete one-time tasks successfully, with retries.
- **CronJob** = Automates Jobs on a schedule, useful for recurring tasks.

Jobs and CronJobs are extensions of Pods that provide reliability and scheduling, 
essential for batch processing and DevOps automation workflows.
