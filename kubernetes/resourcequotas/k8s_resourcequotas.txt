KUBERNETES RESOURCEQUOTA - COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION
=================================================

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
A ResourceQuota is a Kubernetes object that sets constraints on resource usage within a namespace.
It ensures that no single team, workload, or user can consume excessive cluster resources.

Think of it as a "resource budget" for a namespace.

---

2. WHY RESOURCEQUOTA IS REQUIRED
--------------------------------
- Multi-Tenancy: Ensures fair distribution of resources across teams/projects in a shared cluster.
- Prevents Resource Starvation: Stops one workload from consuming all CPU/Memory, affecting others.
- Cost & Stability Control: Prevents runaway workloads from increasing costs or destabilizing apps.
- Governance & Compliance: Helps organizations enforce resource policies for teams.

---

3. RESOURCEQUOTA YAML EXAMPLES
------------------------------

Basic Quota Example:
--------------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: dev-quota
  namespace: dev
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "2"        # Max 2 CPUs requested
    requests.memory: 2Gi     # Max 2Gi memory requested
    limits.cpu: "4"          # Max 4 CPUs allowed
    limits.memory: 4Gi       # Max 4Gi memory allowed
    pods: "10"               # Max 10 Pods in this namespace
    persistentvolumeclaims: "5"
    services: "5"
    configmaps: "10"

---

ResourceQuota with Scopes Example:
----------------------------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: besteffort-quota
  namespace: dev
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "5"
  scopes:
  - BestEffort

Explanation:
- This quota only applies to BestEffort Pods (Pods with no requests/limits defined).
- Forces developers to set requests/limits for their workloads.

---

4. RESOURCEQUOTA WITH LIMITRANGE
---------------------------------
- ResourceQuota controls total namespace resource consumption.
- LimitRange controls per-pod/container resource defaults and max/min values.

Example Use Case:
- ResourceQuota: "Namespace can use up to 4 CPUs".
- LimitRange: "Each Pod must request between 100m and 500m CPU".
- Together: Prevents both overuse and under-requesting of resources.

---

5. WHAT HAPPENS IF QUOTA IS EXCEEDED?
-------------------------------------
- Kubernetes rejects the request with a `Forbidden` error.
- Example: If Pod count exceeds the max quota, creation fails until resources are freed.
- Users must delete existing workloads or administrators must adjust the quota.

---

6. BEST PRACTICES
-----------------
- Always define quotas in multi-tenant clusters.
- Pair with LimitRange to enforce per-Pod defaults.
- Regularly monitor quotas:
  kubectl describe quota dev-quota -n dev
- Avoid setting quotas too low → may block deployments.
- Do not apply quotas on critical namespaces (e.g., kube-system).

---

7. REAL-WORLD USE CASES
-----------------------
- Development Namespace: Restrict to 10 Pods, 2 CPUs, 4Gi RAM → prevents overuse by dev workloads.
- CI/CD Namespace: Restrict ephemeral Pods used in pipelines → ensures jobs don’t overload cluster.
- Production Namespace: Higher quota limits, guaranteeing resources for critical apps.
- Staging/Testing: Enforce strict quotas to mimic production-like behavior but with fewer resources.

---

8. SUMMARY
----------
- ResourceQuota is essential for managing shared cluster environments.
- Ensures fairness, cost control, and stability.
- Works best with LimitRanges for fine-grained control.
- Essential in DevOps workflows where multiple teams share the same Kubernetes cluster.
