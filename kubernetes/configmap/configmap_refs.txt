Difference between configMapRef and configMapKeyRef in Kubernetes:

1. configMapRef:
   - Refers to an entire ConfigMap.
   - Used to inject all keys and values from a ConfigMap as environment variables.
   - Example:
       envFrom:
         - configMapRef:
             name: game-demo
     If game-demo contains:
       data:
         PLAYER_INITIAL_LIVES: "3"
         PLAYER_START_LEVEL: "1"
     Then inside the container:
       PLAYER_INITIAL_LIVES=3
       PLAYER_START_LEVEL=1

2. configMapKeyRef:
   - Refers to a specific key inside a ConfigMap.
   - Used to inject only one value from the ConfigMap as an environment variable.
   - Example:
       env:
         - name: PLAYER_INITIAL_LIVES
           valueFrom:
             configMapKeyRef:
               name: game-demo
               key: PLAYER_INITIAL_LIVES
     Then inside the container:
       PLAYER_INITIAL_LIVES=3

Summary:
- configMapRef → loads all keys/values as env vars.
- configMapKeyRef → loads only one key’s value as an env var.
